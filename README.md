# PUCIT Student Database Management System

## Introduction
This project is a **Database Management System (DBMS)** developed for **PUCIT** to efficiently manage student records, departments, instructors, and courses. The system streamlines data storage, ensures consistency, and facilitates query execution.

## Features
- **Entity-Relationship Model** for structuring data relationships.
- **Relational Schema Construction** using **Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches**.
- **Normalization** up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** for optimized storage.
- **SQL Queries** for common operations (e.g., retrieving student data, department info, instructor assignments).
- **Views** for quick data access.
- **Stored Procedures** for automating student enrollment, grading, and reporting.
- **Functions** to compute averages, count students, and fetch data efficiently.
- **Triggers** for enforcing constraints (e.g., course enrollment limits, prerequisite completion checks).

## Database Schema
Entities:
- **Student (Graduate & Undergraduate)**
- **Instructor**
- **Department**
- **Course**
- **Room**
- **Class**
- **Enrollment**

## Installation
1. Install **Oracle Database** or any SQL-supported DBMS.
2. Execute the provided **CREATE TABLE** scripts.
3. Insert sample data if needed.
4. Run **queries, views, procedures, and triggers** to test functionalities.

## Usage
- **Manage student records** efficiently.
- **Automate enrollment** and grade calculation.
- **Ensure data consistency** with triggers and normalization.

## SQL Highlights
- **Stored Procedures**: Insert new students, enroll in courses, and assign grades.
- **Triggers**: Prevent over-enrollment and enforce prerequisites.
- **Functions**: Compute course grade averages, count students in departments, etc.
